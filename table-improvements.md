# Table Improvements - Column Auto-sizing and Copy Functionality

## Changes Made

### 1. Column Auto-sizing
- Changed table layout from `width: 100%` to `width: auto` with `table-layout: auto`
- Added `white-space: nowrap` to prevent text wrapping
- Set `max-width: 300px` for cells to prevent extremely wide columns
- Added `text-overflow: ellipsis` and `overflow: hidden` for long content

### 2. Click-to-Copy Functionality
- Added click event listeners to all table cells (`td` elements)
- Implemented modern Clipboard API with fallback for older browsers
- Added visual feedback with hover tooltips showing "Click to copy"

### 3. Long Text Handling
- Text longer than 50 characters is automatically truncated with "..." 
- Full content is stored in `data-full-value` attribute
- Visual indicator (â€¦) appears on the right for truncated cells
- Tooltip shows full content on hover for truncated cells

### 4. Visual Feedback
- Added notification system showing "Copied to clipboard!" confirmation
- Notifications appear in top-right corner with smooth animations
- Different hover effects for truncated vs. normal cells
- Added cell borders for better visual separation

### 5. User Experience Enhancements
- Hover effects highlight clickable cells
- Tooltips provide context about copy functionality
- Responsive design maintains readability
- Consistent styling with VS Code theme variables

## How It Works

1. **Auto-sizing**: Columns automatically adjust to content width up to 300px maximum
2. **Copy on Click**: Click any cell to copy its content to system clipboard
3. **Long Text**: Content over 50 characters shows truncated with visual indicator
4. **Feedback**: Success notification appears for 3 seconds after copying

## Technical Implementation

- Uses modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API when available
- Falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')` for compatibility
- Stores full content in HTML data attributes for truncated cells
- CSS-only tooltips and animations for smooth UX
- Event delegation for efficient click handling
